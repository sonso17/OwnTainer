            <div id="text">Hi Everyone my name is Aleix Poch Vil√† and i'm a web developer student. <br>
                Working with hardware was one of my favorites hobbyes since i was 8 that was when i did my first teardown of
                a broken windows 98 lapotop, <br>
                since that day working with hardware was my passion, 4 years ago i started working on building my own sort
                of workshop with lots of different kinds of hardware.
                The question is where do i get all this hardware for free and what i do with it?<br>
                First of all my principal source for collecting hardware is checking in the Ordis rubbish where people throw
                lots of unwanted stuff like computers, TVs, Furniture, etc... and if i find something interesting, i just
                take
                it. I also get stuff from friends that have odl stuff and they don't need anymore or other people tat make
                me a call to give me some unwanted hardware and other sources.<br>
                Then where i got all the stuff with me, i test it to see if it still works or not. If it works fine, i'll do
                it a thorough maintenance with my cleaning tools and i leavit in the box that corresponds if it doesn't work
                i investigate the problem, depending on the problem i still keep it or i put it in a bag for the next time i
                go to the rubbish.<br>
                Thats how basically i work. Now the problem is that my worksop is getting bigger with more hardware and i
                don't know every component specifications so thats why i'm developing OwnTainer, to check, to register, to
                know at the moment whitch hardware i'm working with.<br>
                I love memes so maybe you fins some while exploring thorough the page XD.
